# Ray tracing in Rust

I'm currently learning Rust, so I thought... why not implement a ray tracer,
right? So here we are!

This is, as the title already explains, a ray tracer written in Rust in my spare
time. This work is based on [_Ray Tracing in One
Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
